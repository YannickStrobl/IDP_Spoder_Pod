 * Welcome to the ControlState Service service commentarty. Written by Hidde
 * Westerhof, complaints given by Yannick Strobl cause he touches himself at
 * night. Are you really reading this teachers? I doubt it. Please send an email
 * to Obama@NSA.Gov.us to prove it.
 * 
 * Anyways. ConstrolState service decides wether or not the spider's actions are
 * decided by itself or by the HumanInteraction- Service. This is usefull for
 * autonomous activities and actions performed by the spider, and can be seen as
 * the first step of a failsafe.
 * 
 * @todo Add RouterClient component referrences when it is done.
 * @todo possibly add updates when more services are added.
 * @todo INTERGRATION
 * @version Alpha
